## BeltExtra

Extra functions to help you build great apps using [ReScript](rescript-lang.org/) and the [Belt](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/belt) and [Js](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/js) core libraries.

### Some core principles

- This library adheres to the same principles as Belt/Js: [data-first](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/), simplicity, reasonable naming, functional but pragmatic (most of the time)
- Consistent and predictable naming without the nitpick
- As fast as native can be!
- Documented: get all the goodies of your IDE and the ReScript autocomplete features
- Battle tested in production

### What BeltExtra is _not_

- BeltExtra is not a full featured core library
- It's not intended to replace Belt, or the library you use currently
- It's not _needed_, if you find some helpful functions here and want to add the library to your toolbox we'll be really happy, but you maybe don't need it
- It's not meant to last forever, the day Belt/Js will be powerful enough, we'll happily drop this extra library
